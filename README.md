## Installation

### Install Qualli RN SDK

To add the Qualli RN SDK to your React Native project, you can use:

```bash
yarn add @qualli/qualli-rn-sdk
```

### Dependencies

Our SDK relies on one essential dependency package. Most likely already present in your application.:

-   `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Used for storing local keys that identify the user.

### Install Dependencies

#### 1. Bare RN installation

Install the necessary dependency using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

#### 2. If you are using Expo

To ensure compatibility with Expo, use the following command:

```bash
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

For Expo, you might need to create a development build. Detailed documentation can be found [here](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/installation/).

#### 3. Post-Installation

Install pods

```bash
npx pod install
```

## Usage

### Adding the Provider

To set up Qualli, wrap your main component with `QualliProvider`:

```jsx
import { QualliProvider } from '@qualli/qualli-rn-sdk';

function App() {
    return (
        <QualliProvider apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE">
            {/* Your components */}
        </QualliProvider>
    );
}
```

### Setting Up Triggers

‚ö†Ô∏è The following triggers are reserved for Qualli, and can't be used:

-   `app_user_identified`
-   `app_user_created`
-   `session_started`
-   `session_ended`
-   `app_opened`
-   `app_closed`
-   `app_backgrounded`

To invoke a trigger, use the `performTrigger` function:

```jsx
const qualli = useQualli();
qualli.performTrigger('TRIGGER_NAME');
```

### Setting Custom Attributes

You have the ability to store your own custom attributes on User level. e.g. you want to add their email, or a custom identifier.

To store user-specific attributes, leverage the `setAttributes` function:

Accepted value types:

-   String
-   Number

The following attributes are provided on root user level. These attributes are reserved and cannot be changed by you:

-   email
-   name
-   first_name
-   last_name
-   email
-   unique_identifier
-   last_seen_web
-   last_seen_app
-   sessions_count
-   app_sessions_count
-   web_sessions_count

```jsx
const qualli = useQualli();

qualli.setAttributes({
    email: 'example@email.com',
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Doe',
    custom_attribute: 'value',
});
```
