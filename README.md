## Installation

### Install Qualli RN SDK

To add the Qualli RN SDK to your React Native project, you can use:

```bash
yarn add @qualli/qualli-rn-sdk
```

### Dependencies

Our SDK relies on two essential dependency packages:

-   `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Used for storing local keys that identify the user.
-   `react-native-device-info` - Helps in adding metadata to your users and events.

### Install Dependencies

#### 1. Bare RN installation

Install the necessary dependencies using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info
```

#### 2. If you are using Expo

To ensure compatibility with Expo, use the following commands:

```bash
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-device-info
```

For Expo, you might need to create a development build. Detailed documentation can be found [here](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/installation/).

#### 3. Post-Installation

Install pods

```bash
npx pod install
```

## Usage

### Adding the Provider

To set up Qualli, wrap your main component with `QualliProvider`:

```jsx
import { QualliProvider } from '@qualli/qualli-rn-sdk';

function App() {
    return (
        <QualliProvider apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE">
            {/* Your components */}
        </QualliProvider>
    );
}
```

### Setting Up Triggers

The following triggers are _reserved for Qualli, and can't be used._
Qualli RN SDK provides reserved triggers that your application can use:

-   `app_user_identified`
-   `app_user_created`
-   `session_started`
-   `session_ended`
-   `app_opened`
-   `app_closed`
-   `app_backgrounded`

To invoke a trigger, use the `performTrigger` function:

```jsx
const qualli = useQualli();
qualli.performTrigger('TRIGGER_NAME');
```

### Setting Custom Attributes

To store user-specific attributes, leverage the `setAttributes` function:

```jsx
const qualli = useQualli();

qualli.setAttributes({
    email: 'example@email.com',
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Doe',
    custom_attribute: 'value',
});
```
