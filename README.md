## Installation

### Install Qualli RN SDK

To add the Qualli RN SDK to your React Native project, you can use:

```bash
yarn add @qualli/qualli-rn-sdk
```

### Dependencies

Our SDK relies on one essential dependency package. Most likely already present in your application.:

-   `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Used for storing local keys that identify the user.

### Install Dependencies

#### 1. Bare RN installation

Install the necessary dependency using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

#### 2. If you are using Expo

To ensure compatibility with Expo, use the following command:

```bash
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

For Expo, you might need to create a development build. Detailed documentation can be found [here](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/installation/).

#### 3. Post-Installation

Install pods

```bash
npx pod install
```

## Usage

### Adding the Provider

To set up Qualli, wrap your main component with `QualliProvider`:

```jsx
import { QualliProvider } from '@qualli/qualli-rn-sdk';

function App() {
    return (
        <QualliProvider apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE">
            {/* Your components */}
        </QualliProvider>
    );
}
```

### Setting Up Triggers

‚ö†Ô∏è The following triggers are reserved for Qualli, and can't be used:

-   `app_user_identified`
-   `app_user_created`
-   `session_started`
-   `session_ended`
-   `app_opened`
-   `app_closed`
-   `app_backgrounded`
-   `track_screen`

To invoke a trigger, use the `performTrigger` function:

```jsx
const qualli = useQualli();
qualli.performTrigger('TRIGGER_NAME');
```

### Setting Custom Attributes

You have the ability to store your own custom attributes on User level. e.g. you want to add their email, or a custom identifier.

To store user-specific attributes, leverage the `setAttributes` function:

Accepted value types:

-   String
-   Number

The following attributes are provided on root user level. These attributes are reserved and cannot be changed by you:

-   email
-   name
-   first_name
-   last_name
-   email
-   unique_identifier
-   last_seen_web
-   last_seen_app
-   sessions_count
-   app_sessions_count
-   web_sessions_count

```jsx
const qualli = useQualli();

qualli.setAttributes({
    email: 'example@email.com',
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Doe',
    custom_attribute: 'value',
});
```

### Anonymous vs Identified accounts

By default when a new user opens your app, we will create a anonymous account. When you call `setAttributes` with the `company_identifier` we will create a "active" account.

Anonymous accounts are removed after 14 days, "active" accounts will never be removed. So it's vital to always identify your accounts where possible.

!important!
We will never remove any answers. When we remove the anonymous accounts, all answers remain available.

### Identifying your users

Qualli allows for you to uniquely identify your users, using the `company_identifier` attribute. E.g. when the user logs in to your app, you want all events to be tracked under their main Qualli account, or target them in the audience_filter.

When you set the `company_identifier` we will check if we already have a user with this identifier.

If this is the case: We will transfer the current users attributes to your "parent" user.
If not: We will set the identifier for you to later on re-identify your users.

```jsx
const qualli = useQualli();

qualli.setAttributes({
    email: 'example@email.com',
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Doe',
    custom_attribute: 'value',
    company_identifier: 'YOUR_UNIQUE_ID',
});
```
